// trivia questions (forms?) with multiple choice or true/false
// limited amount of time for each question
// if time runs out, correct answer is displayed for that question
    // without user input, after a few seconds, next question starts
// cannot pick more than one answer per question
// countdown timer displayed
// one question displayed at a time
// after last question display grade and option to start over


// we need
    // question data (list of questions and answers)
        // object literals for questions (an array of them?)
    // a 'start' button that begins the game
    // a 'start over' button at the end of the game that restarts game
    // a timer for each question
    // a right/wrong display for each question
    // a grade display at end of game
    // a method to cycle through questions
